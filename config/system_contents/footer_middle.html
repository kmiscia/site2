<p>
  My name is Kevin Miscia and I'm a software developer and wannabe runner currently hanging my hat in Philadelphia, PA. 
  I'm a Villanova alum with experience in a variety of different web frameworks, and when I'm not out and about on the trails of Philadelphia, I'm making a home for myself in the Ruby on Rails community.
