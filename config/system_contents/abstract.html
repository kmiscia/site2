<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Welcome to a truly unique and engaging website. And by unique and engaging, I mean not at all. There are many sites like this, but this one is mine. It was created by myself, and is a place I like to test out new technology and collect interesting info. Take a look around and check out some of the things I enjoy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miscia.net was built from scratch, and if I learned one thing, it's that you forget how much work goes into creating something like this from the ground up. I doubt it'll ever be truly complete, so I'm pushing it out of the nest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>...</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span>Allow myself to introduce...myself. My name is Kevin Miscia and I'm o</span>riginally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Windsor,_Connecticut" target="_blank">South Windsor, CT</a>.&nbsp;I attended <a href="http://www.villanova.edu" target="_blank">Villanova University</a> and graduated with a major in <a href="http://csc.villanova.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and minor in <a href="http://www.villanova.edu/business/" target="_blank">Business</a>. I live in Philadelphia, originally in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manayunk,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Manayunk</a> and currently in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairmount,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Fairmount</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Back in the day I used to play basketball, baseball and golf in between <a href="http://www.troop880.com/" target="_blank">camping</a> trips. Today I spend most of my time <a href="http://www.letsrun.com/" target="_blank">running</a> the roads and trails of Philadelphia, snowboarding, and reading my favorite and often mocked genre "non-fiction adventure". I'm a rabid <a href="http://www.vuhoops.com">nova&nbsp;basketball</a> fan and sworn enemy of the Uconn Huskies (link purposely omited).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Professionally, I've had the unusual opportunity to work with a variety of web frameworks including Java, .NET and Coldfusion. Currently, I've found a safe harbor in Ruby on Rails, sheltered from the evil soul-crushing reach of Microsoft and Oracle. The <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Rails</a>&nbsp;dev community is unusually passionate about their work, and I'm a better developer surrounded by such people. If you haven't tried it, it's not too late. All the cool kids are doing it.</span></p>
